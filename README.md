## Conference Analyzer

In this project, I used Face API to analyze meetings. The input must be from each user in the meeting, with only their own microphone recording and not others. 
Huge thanks to Web Dev Simplified for giving an awesome tutorial on Face API, check his channel and his video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVClHLwv-4I&t=527s. 
Thanks for my brother for recording the Demo. 
Enjoy!
